## Movie Database

We had to display a homepage that gives an index of the movies we created. <br/>

For this, we created an application that we produced on heroku, you can find it at the following address: https://young-castle-90661.herokuapp.com/ <br/>

* We have created a movie model with a ```title```, a ```release_year``` and a ```directory```.

* There is a seed that contains 5 movies in the application as well as an index that displays all the elements of the model using ```movies_controller```.

* In order to recover all the movies, we have a variable @movies which is an array containing all the movies

* Then we made sure that a ```Director``` could make several movies so that our app shows the movies that the directors did.

## Now 

You can check the code of the application on github or clone it if the instructions ask for it, in this case do not forget to type ```bundle install``` once in the repo folder.
